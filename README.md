ğŸ§ªğŸ’¡ SkillCrafter AI â€“ Personalized Micro-Skill Builder using RAG + Agents
ğŸ§  Project Idea:
SkillCrafter AI is a personalized micro-learning agent that helps users build small, specific skills (like "how to write better cold emails" or "basics of digital painting") in bite-sized lessons using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and a local LLM agent (Ollama).

It pulls content from PDFs, articles, or curated docs and responds with short tutorials, tips, and even mini practice tasks.
